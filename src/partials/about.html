        Hello! I am Barcelolita and I am your photographer. Close people call me
        Lola. The inspiration to do photography found me when I lived in
        Barcelona and every day contemplated the beauty through the lens of my
        camera. That's how Barcelolita was born - my alter ego in photography.
        All that drives me is the passion for what I do, the inspiration to
        capture moments, live them with you and tell your stories.

        Sensual, incredible, sometimes bold — each of us has a special story. My
        inspiration is life in the moment, people, the elements, those that rage
        and make the heart beat faster. I create shoots for people, about people
        and about everything that once was or is someone's passion. I work with
        different styles, offering variable shooting models. My specialization
        is fashion photography, personal, brand photography, lookbooks, couple
        photography and business photos for your personal brand.

          “What I like about
          <span class="about-accent-text">photographs</span>
          is that they capture
          <span class="about-accent-text">a moment</span>
          that’s gone forever, impossible to
          <span class="about-accent-text">reproduce</span>
