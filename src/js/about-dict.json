The inspiration to do photography found me when I lived in Barcelona and every day contemplated the beauty through the lens of my camera. That's how Barcelolita was born - my alter ego in photography. All that drives me is the passion for what I do, the inspiration to capture moments, live them with you and tell your stories.",

        "en": "Sensual, incredible, sometimes bold — each of us has a special story. My inspiration is life in the moment, people, the elements, those that rage and make the heart beat faster. I create shoots for people, about people and about everything that once was or is someone's passion. I work with different styles, offering variable shooting models. My specialization is fashion photography, personal, brand photography, lookbooks, couple photography and business photos for your personal brand.",
